# ReMonitor

**ReMonitor** is a small quality-of-life mod that remembers which monitor Minecraft was last opened on and reopens it there automatically.

By default, Minecraft always launches on the **primary monitor**, which can be annoying for multi-monitor users. ReMonitor fixes this by restoring the game to your last-used display every time you start it.

### Features

* Remembers your last monitor
* Automatic placement with no setup
* Lightweight and performance-friendly
* Restores Fullscreen if needed

Stop dragging windows around and keep Minecraft where you want it with ReMonitor.
